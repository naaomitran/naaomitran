My name is Naomi and I am a 3rd year student at UBC. 
I am majoring in Cognitive Systems: Computational Intelligence & Design.

I just finished my first personal project which has to do with keeping track of the items in your kitchen. You can find me on Instagram @creamricecooks to see this hobby of mine!
