I'm a 3rd year student at UBC, studying cognitive systems: computational intelligence & design.

Just finished my first personal project which has to do with keeping track of the items in your kitchen because food is the key to everyone's heart (especially mine).

You can find me on Instagram @creamricecooks to see just how much I love food!
